                VForce is the culmination of our company’s extensive, long term thinking around what’s needed to make organizations successful. In short, it is the operating platform upon which our client associations function, collaborate and, most importantly, achieve their goals. At its heart, the V Force system has two core components:
            </p>
            <p>• Membership Management System (MMS): Maintaining accurate, thorough records of your organization’s members and participants is vital to all other activities. The V Force MMS component is a full featured membership management environment that supports all aspects of new member enrollment, renewals, upgrades/downgrades and tracking of prospect/member inquiries. It also integrates with our payment gateways and accounting systems. The MMS enables a wide range of reporting. Perhaps most importantly, the MMS provides essential identity management and access control logic for the tools and applications used by client organizations to do their work including the V Force Community component.</p>
            <p>• Community: The Community component of V Force gives groups within client associations such as Boards, Committees, Working Groups, Task Forces, etc. a discreet, web based work space in which to collaborate and communicate. The permissions for these groups is deeply connected to our MMS component, enabling robust security and access control. Within each work space, groups have a variety of tools at this disposal such as discussion threads, document repositories, group calendars, online rosters and voting/polling capabilities.            </p>
